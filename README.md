# 2D-Image-to-3D-Model
Research project named "2D Image to 3D Model"
The creation of detailed 3D models from 2D images is an important area of graphic data processing. In this project, the aim is to realize a physical setup that allows the time- synchronous acquisition of perspective 2D camera images. For this purpose, several cameras, which cover the 3D object to be created in perspective, have to start an image acquisition simultaneously. This setup is to be realized as dynamically as possible, so that the setup can be extended at any time by adding further cameras. The control of the cameras is done by a software module to be created, which controls the single cameras simultaneously. In the second part of the work, the generated images serve as a basis for the automatic generation of 3D mesh models with photogrammetry. Possible geometrical impurities are to be removed automatically to create the best possible three-dimensional image. For this purpose a detailed literature research about the current possibilities of photogrammetry has to be made and its advantages and disadvantages have to be named.
